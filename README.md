## Introduction
Few-shot Adaptation of Training-frEe SAM (FATE-SAM) is a versatile framework for 3D medical image segmentation that adapts the pretrained SAM2 model without fine-tuning. By leveraging a support example-based memory mechanism and volumetric consistency, FATE-SAM enables prompt-free, training-free segmentation across diverse medical datasets. This approach achieves robust performance while eliminating the need for large annotated datasets. For more details and results, please refer to our [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09138).
